# Recommendation Algorithms

## Products come in a variety of forms

- Music
- ...

## People come in a variety of forms

- Preferences ....  
- Requirements ....

You observe the preferences and requirements.

### User-Product Relationship

- Affinity 

### Product-Product Relationship

- What kind of affinities do you find in products?

### User-User Relationship

## Business Insights

- what the user would like?
- if the user buys something, what else they problaby like to buy?
- social networks may find possible friends of you?

All these insights could be monetized.

## How could you monetize it?

Data -> //// ->  Relationships



This system is a "Recommendation Algorithms"

## What Data should I send to the "Recommendation Algorithms"?


















Behaviour / Demographic / Product Attribute


## Products a user already like
- ...
- ...
- ...

What the user probably likes?

- Option 1 -> Products with similar attributes (Content Based Filtering)
- Option 2 -> Products liked by similar users (Collaborative Filtering)
- Option 3 -> Complementary products (Association Rules Learning)

Ratings could be points in an N-Dimensional Space

Proximity between points is a measure of similarity.

How to measure distance:
- Euclidean Distance
- Hamming Distance
- Correlation Distance

# How it works

Data -> Algorithm

Average Ratings User per product
Same dimensional Space
Calculate the Distance
